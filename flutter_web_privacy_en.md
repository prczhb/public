flutter_web Privacy Policy

This policy will come into force on January 1, 2024

flutter_web We respect and protect the privacy of all users, and we have made this Privacy Policy available to the public. Your use of the Software constitutes that you have read and agree to these Terms and Conditions and if you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions please immediately stop using and uninstall the Software.

Information Collection

The software itself does not send any information to the developer, but the app marketplace where you download the software (e.g., Google Play) may collect information about the running status of the app and provide it to the developer. For this information, please read the privacy policy provided by the app market you use.

When you report errors in the operation of the Software to the Developer, the Developer may ask you to provide the Software and system logs to help confirm the cause of the problem. Because the logs may contain sensitive information, such information can only be sent by you. We do not make any express or implied warranties about the security and privacy of any transmission service, and please choose a method that is acceptable to you when transmitting relevant information.

Information Sharing

We do not sell the user data we collect to any third party. We may provide information to external developers to assist in the development of the software, but we will communicate the confidentiality obligations and determine that they can be complied with before providing the information.

Information Retention

Unless required by law, we purge user data that is no longer needed within 30 days, or aggregate statistics into aggregate reports that do not identify individual users.

Information breaches

We will use reasonable technical and security measures to try to protect your data, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data. If we confirm that a data breach has occurred, we will notify the user within 7 days through the available channels. You agree not to hold us liable for any damages caused by force majeure.

Children's Privacy

These services are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we find that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us as soon as possible so that we can take the necessary action.

Modification of Terms

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy, but will ensure that users are notified at least 30 days prior to the update through our available channels and in-app prompts. By continuing to use the Software after the new Terms become effective, you agree to the modified Privacy Policy.
